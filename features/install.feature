Feature: Managing a rails project as a Jenkins CI job on AppCloud
  I want to build/test my project in the same environment I run in Engine Yard AppCloud

  Scenario: Fail to setup Jenkins slave if no default Jenkins server
    Given I am in the "rails" project folder
    When I run local executable "ey-jenkins" with arguments "install ."
    Then I should see exactly
      """
      USAGE: ey-jenkins install . --host HOST --port PORT --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD --ssl

      All arguments default to current jenkins CLI configuration
      (set by 'jenkins list --host HOST --port PORT --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD --ssl')

  Scenario: Setup first project as a slave for Jenkins
